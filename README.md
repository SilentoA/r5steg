# r5steg
Text in text steganography program using zero width space characters.

# Under development
This piece of free software is currently on BETA phase, feel free to report any bugs or contribute with a PR!
## To do list:
- Support decoding multiple messages at once
- Add compression (maybe using trinary, quaternary, or more bases instead of binary)
- Add encryption with passwords

# Requirements
For now it uses:
- [**pyperclip**](https://pyperclip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for auto copy-to-clipboard. 
- [**readline**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html) for input usability.
